 Use a numpad to control media playback

## what's the point of this?
 I have an old, low power laptop connected via HDMI to my TV. Rather than using a TV box, firestick, chromecast etc with all the privacy and security problems that entails, I simply use a PC with a web browser open to watch Netflix, Apple TV, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime and so forth. I use a wireless mouse and keyboard, but those are often impractical to control the playback quickly. For example, I typically just want a handful of functions: pause/play, make full-screen, skip forward/back. A full keyboard does those things just fine, but they're pretty big. A mouse will also do that, but doing it from a sofa is kind of annoying, and you can't do it very quickly.

 So I got an external wireless numpad and wrote this autohotkey script so that the buttons will send media control keys instead of their normal keys.

 ## Most useful keys
 - . (decimal point/full stop key) => play/pause (k)
 - 4 and 6 => fwd/back skip (arrow left/right)
 - 5 => full screen (f)
 - Numlock => esc
 - 0 => windows play/pause (sends the media play/pause key that windows operates - useful in some scenarios)
